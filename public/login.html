Log in to registry - 
Random thought - I think it would look like this:
This page would say "Please enter the name of the registry you are trying to look at." The user would then enter the name of the registry and then be taken to another splash page with two buttons: One to view and purchase gifts (i.e. Bamazon customer view) and another to add gifts and maybe see what's been purchased (i.e. Bamazon manager view). The second one would require authentication on the part of the couple.
