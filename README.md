Project 2: Gift Registry Thing!

This is an app that will allow users to create their own custom gift registries! Simply create a user, then add items to your list, and then people will be able to choose items from your list to purchase!

...once we update this to the point where guests can see a registry.

For now, though, we're using:

-MySQL as our database for holding users and products
-Sequelize to run the commands for adding and changing products/users
-JSON Web Tokens for user authentication
-bcrypt to hash passwords
